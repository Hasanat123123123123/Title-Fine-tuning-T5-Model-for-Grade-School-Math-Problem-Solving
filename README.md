# Title-Fine-tuning-T5-Model-for-Grade-School-Math-Problem-Solving

Task Description: This task involves fine-tuning an LLM (Llama or T5)
language model to solve grade school math word problems using the
GSM8K dataset. The dataset consists of high-quality math word
problems, each with a corresponding full solution that includes multiple
reasoning steps and calculator annotations. The goal is to train the model
to generate accurate solutions to these problems through a series of
multi-step reasoning.
ï‚¡ You also need to show me inference GUI for your trained model for
demo
